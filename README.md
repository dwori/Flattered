## Introduction
Flattered is a web application developed for people living in shared flats. It is designed to support them to manage their flats and members of it. The grocery list for a flat can also be filled, checked, edited and updated. The user creating a flat automatically gets assigned the admin role. This particular user only is in charge of editing or deleting the flat, as well as inviting other users by using the unique access token.
If a user is assigned to multiple flats or the dashboard displays a “No Flat” message, the user will have to switch his current flat by selecting it in the “switch active flat” dropdown in the dashboard.
